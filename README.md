# ü•î MicroWakeWord Trainer ‚Äì Tater Approved  

**‚úÖ Tater Totterson tested & working on an NVIDIA RTX 3070 Laptop GPU (8 GB VRAM).**  
Easily train microWakeWord detection models with this pre-built Docker image and JupyterLab notebook.  

---

## üöÄ Quick Start  

Follow these steps to get up and running:  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Pull the Pre-Built Docker Image  

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/tatertotterson/microwakeword:latest
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Docker Container  

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
    --gpus all \
    -p 8888:8888 \
    -v $(pwd):/data \
    ghcr.io/tatertotterson/microwakeword:latest
```

**What these flags do:**  
- `--gpus all` ‚Üí Enables GPU acceleration  
- `-p 8888:8888` ‚Üí Exposes JupyterLab on port 8888  
- `-v $(pwd):/data` ‚Üí Saves your work in the current folder  

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Open JupyterLab  

Visit [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) in your browser ‚Äî the notebook UI will open.  

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Set Your Wake Word  

At the **top of the notebook**, find this line:  

```bash
TARGET_WORD = "hey_tater"  # Change this to your desired wake word
```

Change `"hey_tater"` to your desired wake word (phonetic spellings often work best).  

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Notebook  

Run all cells in the notebook. This process will:  
- Generate wake word samples  
- Train a detection model  
- Output a quantized `.tflite` model ready for on-device use  

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieve the Trained Model & JSON  

When training finishes, download links for both the `.tflite` model and its `.json` manifest will be displayed in the last cell.  

---

## üîÑ Resetting to a Clean State  

If you need to start fresh:  

1. Delete the `data` folder that was mapped to your Docker container.  
2. Restart the container using the steps above.  
3. A fresh copy of the notebook will be placed into the `data` directory.
